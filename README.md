The coronavirus pandemic took us all by surprise in 2020. Teaching had to be switched from face-to-face to online in a very short space of time and teaching concepts had to be adapted for such a format. 
Many have used this moment to integrate new digital possibilities into their courses. We, too, have reflected on our teaching experiences and jointly developed a new teaching concept for the graded compulsory course on computer-assisted scientific work (CWA) in the Bachelor's degree programme in Psychology. 
In this article, we would like to present the teaching concept, share our experiences and motivate interested lecturers to continue this pilot project.

All video tutorials, session scripts, exercises and data sets can be found in the subfolder ‘Session Scripts and Videos’.

Here we publish the materials for our Open Education teaching concept for computer-aided scientific work as part of the Bachelor's programme in Psychology. 
Further information can be found in the folder 00_Course_Overview_Materials or in
